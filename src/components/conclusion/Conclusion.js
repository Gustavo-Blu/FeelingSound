        If I had been given more time, I would’ve organized and developed my
        code more. I would’ve loved to code more servos to give a better and
        more accurate device as well as manipulate the rate at which the servos
        rotate. Being able to let them move up slowly instead of just them just
        pushing up harshly at the sign of any input they receive. Feeling Sound
        was a project I had fun developing all the way through. Although the
        final product may not have been what I had hoped for in the beginning, I
        still feel delighted and proud of what I have created. This project has
        absolutely inspired me to try out similar ideas in the future.
